ARCHIVE CONTENTS

The data contained in this archive are the final version of GPWv3, and
should be used instead of the previous (alpha, beta) versions.

This archive contains low-resolution versions of the population density grids, both 
UN-adjusted and unadjusted, in ASCII format. The raster data are at 1 degree
(60 arc-minutes) resolution and contain the following data:

ds90g60		population densities in 1990, unadjusted, persons per square km
ds90ag60	population densities in 1990, adjusted to match UN totals, persons per square km

The ASCII format stores the data as simple text. The first lines
of the file give the resolution, number of rows and columns, no data 
value, and rotation factors.

The data are stored in geographic coordinates of decimal degrees based 
on the World Geodetic System spheroid of 1984 (WGS84).
